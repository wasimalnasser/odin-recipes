        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Filling, savory, and one of the easiest things you could make, this <strong>Breakfast Power Bowl</strong> has got it all. The protein and healthy fats will keep you satiated and less hungry throughout the day.

        And if losing weight is your thing, I had a variation of this for breakfast almost every day last week, and it helped me lose 3.5 pounds my first week back on plan!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 avocado</li>
        <li>50g red onion</li>
        <li>50g cucumber</li>
        <li>10g jalapeno</li>
        <li>1/2 lime</li>
        <li>Sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>Cilantro (fresh or dried)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
       <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making your medium-boiled eggs. I bring a pot of water to a boil, then drop eggs in right out of the fridge for 8 minutes and 25 seconds.</li>
        <li>Grab your favorite bowl and add 1 serving of cottage cheese as the layer. If you don’t like the curds, you can always process the cottage cheese in a blender or food processor for a creamy, curd-less spin.</li>
        <li>Next, remove your eggs from the ice bath, remove the shell, slice into your favorite shape, and add them on top.</li>
        <li>Finally, add some lower calorie flavorful additions. I like to add fresh cilantro, some super finely diced red onion, and lots of truffle hot sauce. You can add whatever you like. Fresh veggies like cucumbers, tomatoes, and jalapeños would be great here, too.</li>

    </ol>
